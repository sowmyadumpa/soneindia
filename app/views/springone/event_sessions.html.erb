                         <h3><a href="../session_61.htm">Introduction to WebSockets</a> </h3>

                         <p>The WebSockets technology promises to fill a niche in web applications by enabling browsers and servers to exchange messages with high frequency, low latency and low bandwith requirements in full duplex mode. The WebSocket protocol is an IETF standard, the WebSocket API is almost standardized by the W3C, and the JSR-356 will deliver a Java API in Java EE 7. There are already implementations in node.js and in a number of Servlet containers and Java frameworks. The time is as good as ever to start digging into it and there is so much to consider — from getting familiar with the protocol and the API, to sorting through the choices on the browser and on the server side, practical challenges with browser support and network issues, and so on. Furthermore, WebSockets offer a messaging-style architecture that's in sharp contrast to the RESTful architectures that connect the web today, so learning where to draw the line will be essential. </p>

                         <p>The continuous evolution of both the Spring Framework and the Java EE platform presents us with new challenges and opportunities for collaboration. Several recent EE services are very commonly used with Spring, e.g. Servlet 3.0, JPA 2.0 and Bean Validation.

                         <p>As users become more tech-savvy their ability and desire to build their own applications grows. Gartner predicts that by 2014, business developers will build at least 25% of new business applications. Commonly these applications must access and update corporate data sources. </p>

<p>Increasingly business developers want to deliver mobile solutions. Gone are the days of under the desk Access, Notes and Excel applications. IT needs to enable, manage, and control these applications to ensure standards for security, reliability, and maintainability. </p>

<p>This session will describe the kinds of people who should build applications and the types of applications they can build. We'll demonstrate using real world examples, integrating database and web services. We will build a Dojo and Spring application from scratch. From which, we will build a native iOS and Android app using PhoneGap.</p>

                         <h3><a href="../session_57.htm">Extending Spring MVC with Spring Mobile and JavaScript</a> </h3>

                         <p>The modern web no longer is limited to desktop browsers. Smart phones and tablets have become an integral part of our daily lives. Web sites that may look good on a 22" monitor usually do not format and display well on a much smaller screen. Additionally, network speeds can limit the performance of a web site on mobile devices. Because of these reasons many developers and organizations are considering how to make their web sites accessible to all the various devices and screen sizes for which people are using. In this session, we will explore the functionality provided within the Spring Mobile project, and how you can use it to extend your Spring MVC application onto mobile and tablet devices. We'll then continue the discussion by demonstrating how you can leverage some of the popular mobile JavaScript frameworks in combination with Spring Mobile to provide a first class experience for your users on mobile devices.</p>

                         <p>Over the last year a number of significant changes have been made to the infrastructure and processes used within the Spring family of projects. In this presentation we will review these process changes and provide valuable insights into the tools that make it all possible. We will begin with providing a brief history, then move on to discuss the new tools being used, such as GitHub, Gradle, and Artifactory. Beyond describing the tools, we'll also illustrate how these new tools help facilitate our processes, including community contributions, release management, defect tracking, and more. Ultimately, this presentation will paint a larger picture of the development process for open source projects at Spring, and the various outlets available for community involvement.</p>

                         <p>More and more applications are being built with JavaScript, and not only for the client side but also utilising JavaScript server side. As the complexity of JavaScript applications increases there is a need for the tools to improve – textmate isn’t necessarily the answer! The user shouldn’t need to lower their expectations when stepping out of amazing Java tools and tackling JavaScript development.                     In this session we will present our vision for tooling for the JavaScript era and demo some early versions and prototypes of what we think the next generation JavaScript tools could look like. </p>

                         <p>Customer interest in virtualizing Java workloads has been growing exponentially year on year. For the last few years, the focus has been largely around looking for best practice guidance to mitigate concerns around virtualizing Java workloads, particularly in the area of performance. Since joining VMware, SpringSource has been investing in providing first class support for the Java runtime on vSphere with products such as EM4J. Combined with the industry-leading capabilities of the vSphere platform and the growing product portfolio around the Java ecosystem, there are many great reasons to virtualize Java. </p>

                         <p>Graphs are everywhere. From websites adding social capabilities to Telcos providing personalized customer services, to innovative bioinformatics research, organizations are adopting graph databases as the best way to model and query connected data. If you can whiteboard, you can model your domain in a graph database.</p>

<p>In this session Emil Eifrem provides a close look at the graph model and offers best use cases for effective, cost-efficient data storage and accessibility.</p>

<p>Take Aways:
Understand the model of a graph database and how it compares to document and relational databases
Understand why graph databases are best suited for the storage, mapping and querying of connected data</p>

<p>Emil's presentation will be followed by a Hands-on Guide to Spring Data Neo4j.
Spring Data Neo4j provides straightforward object persistence into the Neo4j graph database. Conceived by Rod Johnson and Neo Technology CEO Emil Eifrem, it is the founding project of the Spring Data effort. The library leverages a tight integration with the Spring Framework and the Spring Data infrastructure. Besides the easy to use object graph mapping it offers the powerful graph manipulation and query capabilities of Neo4j with a convenient API. </p>

<p>The talk introduces the different aspects of Spring Data Neo4j and shows applications in several example domains. </p>

<p>During the session we walk through the creation of a engaging sample application that starts with the setup and annotating the domain objects. We see the usage of Neo4jTemplate and the powerful repository abstraction. After deploying the application to a cloud PaaS we execute some interesting query use-cases on the collected data. </p>

The poor application is now showing its years and doesn't perform like it did when it was first architected. Now through the help of a new platform, this application has an opportunity to shine again. Taking a look at past projects that have gone through similar transformations we will look at patterns and processes that can be leveraged to redesign traditional JEE applications into lightweight applications using Spring, CXF, SpringMVC, and SOA. Finally, we will walk through code examples to show how quickly applications can be developed using this new stack.</p>

                         <p>Some applications simply cannot be contained.  Perhaps you want to write a worker that periodically polls for updates or performs a maintenance task.  Perhaps you would like to use a new lightweight web framework.  You don’t necessarily want to build a WAR for these types of apps.  With Cloud Foundry, you don’t have to!  In this session, we will build and deploy several types of standalone applications, from distributed workers built with Spring Integration and Akka, to container-less web applications built with vert.x and spray, to bring-your-own-container apps that embed Jetty.  If you’re a Java or Scala developer who likes to “think outside the container”, this talk is for you!</p>

Come to this session to get an in-depth view of the latest and greatest in Cloud Foundry.  It's easier than ever before to build and deploy your distributed polyglot applications.  You will see some exciting new options, including new Java and Node runtimes and support for background workers and container-less web apps.  These features allow you to create distributed apps comprised of many smaller, focused apps each written in the framework that fits its purpose best.  We will also explore the latest in tooling, including new features in the STS plugin and the brand new "next gen" VMC client. We will peek under the hood to see what's new in the Cloud Foundry architecture.  You may even get a sneak preview of some upcoming features!

                         <p>The WebSockets technology promises to fill a niche in web applications by enabling browsers and servers to exchange messages with high frequency, low latency and low bandwith requirements in full duplex mode. The WebSocket protocol is an IETF standard, the WebSocket API is almost standardized by the W3C, and the JSR-356 will deliver a Java API in Java EE 7. There are already implementations in node.js and in a number of Servlet containers and Java frameworks. The time is as good as ever to start digging into it and there is so much to consider — from getting familiar with the protocol and the API, to sorting through the choices on the browser and on the server side, practical challenges with browser support and network issues, and so on. Furthermore, WebSockets offer a messaging-style architecture that's in sharp contrast to the RESTful architectures that connect the web today, so learning where to draw the line will be essential. </p>

                         <p>In this session you will learn what Spring Integration and Spring Batch are all about, how they differ, their commonalities, and how you can use Spring Batch and Spring Integration together.</p>

<p>We will provide a short overview of the Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) as described in the highly influential book of the same name. Based on these patterns, we will then see how Spring Integration enables the development of Message-driven applications. This allows you to not only modularize new or existing applications but also makes it easy to integrate with external systems.</p>

<p>This session will also introduce Spring Batch. Spring Batch addresses the needs of any batch process, be it complex calculations in large financial institutions or simple data migration tasks as they exist in many software development projects. We will cover what Spring Batch is, how Spring approaches the concepts of batch and how Spring handles scaling batch processes to be able to handle any volume of data.</p>

<p>You will also see how Spring Integration and Spring Batch maximize the reuse of the integration support provided by the core Spring Framework. In addition to providing a robust, proven foundation, this also flattens the learning curve considerably to all developers already familiar with Spring.</p>

In this presentation we will review these process changes and provide valuable insights into the tools that make it all possible. We will begin with providing a brief history, then move on to discuss the new tools being used, such as GitHub, Gradle, and Artifactory. Beyond describing the tools, we'll also illustrate how these new tools help facilitate our processes, including community contributions, release management, defect tracking, and more. Ultimately, this presentation will paint a larger picture of the development process for open source projects at Spring, and the various outlets available for community involvement.</p>

                         <h3><a href="../session_77.htm">Addressing the Big Data Challenge with a Graph</a> </h3>

                         <p>Graphs are everywhere. From websites adding social capabilities to Telcos providing personalized customer services, to innovative bioinformatics research, organizations are adopting graph databases as the best way to model and query connected data. If you can whiteboard, you can model your domain in a graph database.</p>

<p>In this session Emil Eifrem provides a close look at the graph model and offers best use cases for effective, cost-efficient data storage and accessibility.</p>

<p>Take Aways:
Understand the model of a graph database and how it compares to document and relational databases
Understand why graph databases are best suited for the storage, mapping and querying of connected data</p>

<p>Emil's presentation will be followed by a Hands-on Guide to Spring Data Neo4j.
Spring Data Neo4j provides straightforward object persistence into the Neo4j graph database. Conceived by Rod Johnson and Neo Technology CEO Emil Eifrem, it is the founding project of the Spring Data effort. The library leverages a tight integration with the Spring Framework and the Spring Data infrastructure. Besides the easy to use object graph mapping it offers the powerful graph manipulation and query capabilities of Neo4j with a convenient API. </p>

<p>The talk introduces the different aspects of Spring Data Neo4j and shows applications in several example domains. </p>

<p>During the session we walk through the creation of a engaging sample application that starts with the setup and annotating the domain objects. We see the usage of Neo4jTemplate and the powerful repository abstraction. After deploying the application to a cloud PaaS we execute some interesting query use-cases on the collected data. </p>

                         <p>We've been busy making improvements and adding features since Cloud Foundry's first birthday!  Come to this session to get an in-depth view of the latest and greatest in Cloud Foundry.  It's easier than ever before to build and deploy your distributed polyglot applications.  You will see some exciting new options, including new Java and Node runtimes and support for background workers and container-less web apps.  These features allow you to create distributed apps comprised of many smaller, focused apps each written in the framework that fits its purpose best.  We will also explore the latest in tooling, including new features in the STS plugin and the brand new "next gen" VMC client. We will peek under the hood to see what's new in the Cloud Foundry architecture.  You may even get a sneak preview of some upcoming features!  From Cloud Foundry beginner to expert, this session has something for everyone.</p>

                         <p>If you have deployed applications on Cloud Foundry, you know how easy it is to push an app, bind services to it, and scale it. There are more magical things behind the scenes. Did you know, for example, that cloudfoundry.com is updated approximately twice a week? Each update included small changes such as a bug fix or a new feature, but often large changes such as updating the underlying operating system. Yet, we can do all this without any downtime for user apps. Come to this talk to understand what makes this possible. Even if you aren't going to ever implement a PaaS on your own (and why should you? we already give you a good one!), the architectural ideas apply to your distributed apps quite well.</p>

As the complexity of JavaScript applications increases there is a need for the tools to improve – textmate isn’t necessarily the answer! The user shouldn’t need to lower their expectations when stepping out of amazing Java tools and tackling JavaScript development.                     In this session we will present our vision for tooling for the JavaScript era and demo some early versions and prototypes of what we think the next generation JavaScript tools could look like. </p>

                         <p>Spring Integration is a lightweight integration framework from the makers of Spring. Integration of data and services between applications is not easy – and often requires adaptation from one system to another. Spring Integration also promotes loosely coupled, event-driven applications. Spring Batch is a batch processing framework – providing a simple, idiomatic way to crunch large amounts of data across in a sustainable way. Spring Batch even allows you to distribute processing across multiple machines in a cluster. Naturally, both of these frameworks play very nicely on top of Cloud Foundry, which lets you scale up and out as demand requires. </p>

                         <p>The Spring Data project is an umbrella project that provides a familiar and consistent Spring-based programming model for a wide range of data access technologies.  Motivated by the rise of new NoSQL databases and Big Data solutions, there is support for Redis, MongoDB, HBase, Neo4j, Gemfire, Hadoop and Splunk.   There is also a “refresh” of Spring’s traditional support for JDBC and JPA.  In this session, we will provide a guided tour of the Spring Data feature set, showing how you can quickly increase your productivity when creating applications that use these new data access technologies.   Use cases unique to each technology will be discussed and demonstrated as well as where Spring Data provides some level of portability between different databases.</p>

                         <p>Actor based concurrency model is a paradigm shift. What is paradigm shift?</p>

<p>A change in the basic assumptions, or paradigms, within the ruling theory of science. A paradigm shift makes simple ideas hard to grok. Even though Actor model is a simple and revolutionary idea it becomes hard for programmers to see practical benefits and usage. Similarly, the Scala programming language brings a lot to the table in simplifying actor-based design, but comes with a new style of coding.  One possible solution to this problem is to evaluate the new paradigm in terms of old paradigm. In this presentation we will take a working Spring based web application and gradually implement it using actors and Scala. We will be skeptical and suspicious of new ideas but at the same time we will be open minded. We will learn about actor based concurrency model using the knowledge of spring.  At the same time, we'll learn best practices behind Actors, Scala and combining these with the Spring Framework.</p>

                         <p>In this session you will learn what Spring Integration and Spring Batch are all about, how they differ, their commonalities, and how you can use Spring Batch and Spring Integration together.</p>

<p>We will provide a short overview of the Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) as described in the highly influential book of the same name. Based on these patterns, we will then see how Spring Integration enables the development of Message-driven applications. This allows you to not only modularize new or existing applications but also makes it easy to integrate with external systems.</p>

<p>This session will also introduce Spring Batch. Spring Batch addresses the needs of any batch process, be it complex calculations in large financial institutions or simple data migration tasks as they exist in many software development projects. We will cover what Spring Batch is, how Spring approaches the concepts of batch and how Spring handles scaling batch processes to be able to handle any volume of data.</p>

<p>You will also see how Spring Integration and Spring Batch maximize the reuse of the integration support provided by the core Spring Framework. In addition to providing a robust, proven foundation, this also flattens the learning curve considerably to all developers already familiar with Spring.</p>

                         <p>The WebSockets technology promises to fill a niche in web applications by enabling browsers and servers to exchange messages with high frequency, low latency and low bandwith requirements in full duplex mode. The WebSocket protocol is an IETF standard, the WebSocket API is almost standardized by the W3C, and the JSR-356 will deliver a Java API in Java EE 7. There are already implementations in node.js and in a number of Servlet containers and Java frameworks. The time is as good as ever to start digging into it and there is so much to consider — from getting familiar with the protocol and the API, to sorting through the choices on the browser and on the server side, practical challenges with browser support and network issues, and so on. Furthermore, WebSockets offer a messaging-style architecture that's in sharp contrast to the RESTful architectures that connect the web today, so learning where to draw the line will be essential. </p>

                         <h3><a href="../session_110.htm">Understanding Java Garbage Collection and what you can do about it</a> </h3>

                         <p>Garbage Collection is an integral part of application behavior on Java platforms, yet it is often misunderstood. As such, it is important for Java developers to understand the actions you can take in selecting and tuning collector mechanisms, as well as in your application architecture choices.  In this session, Gil Tene (CTO, Azul Systems) will review and classify the various garbage collectors and collection techniques available in JVMs today. Following a quick overview of common garbage collection techniques including generational, parallel, stop-the-world, incremental, concurrent and mostly-concurrent algorithms, we will define terms and metrics common to all collectors. We will classify each major JVM collector's mechanisms and characteristics and discuss the tradeoffs involved in balancing requirements for responsiveness, throughput, space, and available memory across varying scale levels. We will conclude with some pitfalls, common misconceptions, and "myths" around garbage collection behavior, as well as examples of how some good choices can result in impressive application behavior.</p>

                         <p>Broadleaf Commerce is a feature rich, highly customizable, open source eCommerce framework built on top of The Spring Framework.  Spring provides a huge number of container services such as dependency injection, AOP, transaction management, MVC, JPA support, security, etc.  Broadleaf leveraged Spring's features to provide a highly functional and extensible eCommerce framework.  Where Spring is a technical development framework, Broadleaf is an eCommerce domain-specific development framework.  Broadleaf Commerce has extended Spring with a unique application context merge process to allow implementors to extend, override, and control every component of the Broadleaf Framework.  Kelly will provide an overview of the Broadleaf features, along with a deeper dive into some of the more advanced technical capabilities of Broadleaf Commerce and how they are made possible by Broadleaf's use and extension of The Spring Framework.</p>

Round-trip server-side HTML rendering doesn't fit the bill any longer and numerous JavaScript frameworks have stepped forward to simplify development of client-side user-interfaces.

Web sites that may look good on a 22" monitor usually do not format and display well on a much smaller screen. Additionally, network speeds can limit the performance of a web site on mobile devices. Because of these reasons many developers and organizations are considering how to make their web sites accessible to all the various devices and screen sizes for which people are using. In this session, we will explore the functionality provided within the Spring Mobile project, and how you can use it to extend your Spring MVC application onto mobile and tablet devices. We'll then continue the discussion by demonstrating how you can leverage some of the popular mobile JavaScript frameworks in combination with Spring Mobile to provide a first class experience for your users on mobile devices.</p>

      Josh Suereth is a Senior Software Engineer at Typesafe and the author of "Scala In Depth.” He has been a Scala enthusiast ever since he came to know this beautiful language in 2007. He started his professional career as a software developer in 2004, cutting his teeth with C++, STL, and Boost. Around the same time, Java fever was spreading and his interest was migrating to web-hosted distributed Java-delivered solutions to aide health departments discover the outbreaks of disease - everything from EJB to Hibernate/Spring and even some Applets. He introduced Scala into his company code base first in 2007, and soon after he was infected by Scala fever, contributing to the Scala IDE, maven-Scala-plugin, and Scala itself. In 2009, he began writing the book "Scala In Depth" which provides practical support for using Scala in everyday applications. Today, Josh is the author of several open source Scala projects, including the Scala automated resource management library, the PGP sbt plugin, as well as contributing to key components in the Scala ecosystem, like the maven-Scala-plugin. His current work at Typesafe Inc. has him doing anything from building MSIs to profiling performance issues. Josh regularly shares his expertise in articles and talks.<br /><br />
