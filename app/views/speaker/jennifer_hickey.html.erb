    <h2>Presentations</h2>


    <h3><a href="../topics/keeping_up_with_constantly_changing_it_environments.htm">Keeping Up with Constantly Changing IT Environments</a></h3>

		<p>Today's IT infrastructure undergoes constant change due to technology shifts, cost, scalability, and complexity.  This session will cover the features of Hyperic HQ specially designed to handle the high frequency of change, including its broad and extensible support of technologies, powerful auto-discovery, real-time change detection, global resource type templates, events and alerts generation, and scriptable web services API that automate inventory management.</p>
<p>Session Detail</p>
<h3><a href="../topics/monitoring__troubleshooting_and_tuning_web_application_in_production_environments.htm">Monitoring, troubleshooting and tuning web application in production environments</a></h3>

		<p>Managing production environments offers a large set of challenges. Restricted access, a limited tool set, unpredictable traffic patterns  and organizational gaps are only a few. To overcome these barriers one must understand the process, the runtime environment and the practical application of technologies and their behaviours. In this interactive session we will demonstrate capabilities that enable developers, administrators, and operators to diagnose, measure, and monitor their applications and the infrastructure their applications are deployed on.  The goal is to achieve swift isolation, correct diagnosis and minimum impact resolution.</p>
<p>Session Detail</p>
<h3><a href="../topics/case_study__migrating_hyperic_hq_from_ejb_to_spring.htm">Case Study: Migrating Hyperic HQ from EJB to Spring</a></h3>

		<p>This session will cover the migration from the technical specifics all the way to motivations, project planning, and end results </p>
<p>Session Detail</p>
<h3><a href="../topics/cloud_foundry_with_spring_part_one__applications.htm">Cloud Foundry with Spring Part One: Applications</a></h3>

		<p>The session provides an overview of how to build Spring-based applications on the Cloud Foundry platform. The session will cover application configuration parameters, binding services to you application, configuration using STS and vmc commands, and deployment to both micro and public Cloud Foundry. We will also show how debugging works with Cloud Foundry. The session will also discuss application execution analysis and cover how to inspect, determine and resolve execution issues associated with running Spring applications in this cloud architecture.</p>
<p>Session Detail</p>
<h3><a href="../topics/cloud_foundry_with_spring_part_two__services.htm">Cloud Foundry with Spring Part Two: Services</a></h3>

		<p>This session covers much greater detail about how Spring operates on the Cloud Foundry platform. We will also explore various options to consume services: auto-configuration, the cloud namespace, and Spring 3.1 profiles focusing on how to utilize these mechanisms effectively in various phases of application development cycle.</p>
<p>Session Detail</p>
<h3><a href="../topics/what_s_new_in_cloud_foundry.htm">What's New in Cloud Foundry</a></h3>

		<p>We've been busy making improvements and adding features since Cloud Foundry's first birthday!  Come to this session to get an in-depth view of the latest and greatest in Cloud Foundry.  It's easier than ever before to build and deploy your distributed polyglot applications.  You will see some exciting new options, including new Java and Node runtimes and support for background workers and container-less web apps.  These features allow you to create distributed apps comprised of many smaller, focused apps each written in the framework that fits its purpose best.  We will also explore the latest in tooling, including new features in the STS plugin and the brand new "next gen" VMC client. We will peek under the hood to see what's new in the Cloud Foundry architecture.  You may even get a sneak preview of some upcoming features!  From Cloud Foundry beginner to expert, this session has something for everyone.</p>
<p>Session Detail</p>
<h3><a href="../topics/cloud_foundry_bootcamp.htm">Cloud Foundry Bootcamp</a></h3>

		<p>Hands on guide and introduction for Cloud Foundry for novices. This sessions covers the basics of accessing the Cloud Foundry platform as a service, how to use cloudfoundry.com, how to install and use Micro Cloud Foundry on your laptop, and covers the basics vmc commands for the platform. The session will provide hands on troubleshooting for developers that want to install and set-up Cloud Foundry in the session.</p>
<p>Session Detail</p>
<h3><a href="../topics/thinking_outside_the_container_running_standalone_apps_on_cloud_foundry.htm">Thinking Outside the Container: Running Standalone Apps on Cloud Foundry</a></h3>

		<p>Some applications simply cannot be contained.  Perhaps you want to write a worker that periodically polls for updates or performs a maintenance task.  Perhaps you would like to use a new lightweight web framework.  You don’t necessarily want to build a WAR for these types of apps.  With Cloud Foundry, you don’t have to!  In this session, we will build and deploy several types of standalone applications, from distributed workers built with Spring Integration and Akka, to container-less web applications built with vert.x and spray, to bring-your-own-container apps that embed Jetty.  If you’re a Java or Scala developer who likes to “think outside the container”, this talk is for you!</p>
